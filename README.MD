## Steps to run the code
1) First clone the code from the github using the link: https://github.com/josh-dittmer/cs151-facebook-clone.git
2) Next open it in a Java IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse
3) Once the application is open, a popup on the lower right hand corner will show up (IntelliJ) saying "Maven Build Script Found". Click the Load Button to load the script.
4) Now head to the Application class. It can be found using the path ../backend/src/main/java/apps/Application.java
5) Once you are at the Application.java file, run it. 
   * Note: If you get a message in the terminal saying "Failed to create app" then you might have to delete all the "db" folders before re-running
6) Now head to the terminal and go to the frontend directory (../frontend). Run "npm install" if this is your first time running the program
7) Now once npm is installed type "npm run dev" into the terminal
8) A link should then pop up on the terminal. http://localhost:3000. Click it and it should lead you to the website.
   * Note: If you get a blank white page, run this link instead:  http://localhost:3000/login
9) Congratulations! You are now at the login page. You will have to Sign-up if it is your first time. 

 > One last note, make sure both the backend or the frontend are running. Otherwise the program will not work properly!
